## Authentication Page
Building a Authentication Page in the UI Design I included Google/Apple Firebase Authentication but I am thinking to Remove it and replace it with only email and password.

## HomePage
I think its one of the easiest page in a decentralized sense but I am facing some issues to host data.

## Search Page
This is the easisest page, I call it stalking page where I stalk my crush, I am not including recents here for avoiding my personal embarasements.
